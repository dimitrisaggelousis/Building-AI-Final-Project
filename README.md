# Building-AI-Final-Project
Final project for the Building AI course. This project presents my AI idea, describing the problem it solves, the data and AI methods used, how it works, challenges, and potential future improvements.
## Summary

This is my final project for the Building AI course. The project proposes an AI assistant that helps users organize their daily tasks and schedule by predicting optimal task order and completion times. Building AI course project.
## Background

Many people struggle to manage their daily tasks efficiently, often forgetting or delaying important activities. This AI assistant aims to solve this problem by predicting the best order to complete tasks and suggesting schedules. The motivation is to help users save time, reduce stress, and increase productivity. 

Problems addressed:
* Difficulty in prioritizing tasks
* Forgetting or delaying tasks
* Inefficient daily schedules
## How is it used?

The AI assistant is designed to be used on smartphones and computers. Users enter their daily tasks, deadlines, and priorities, and the system suggests an optimized schedule, showing which tasks to complete first and estimating completion times. It adapts over time based on user behavior and feedback, learning preferences and improving recommendations. The solution is aimed at anyone who wants to manage their time more efficiently, including students, professionals, and busy parents.
## Data sources and AI methods

The AI assistant uses data provided directly by the user, such as tasks, deadlines, priorities, and estimated durations. Optional data can include calendar events and reminders. 

The system can be implemented using:
* Machine learning regression models to predict task completion times.
* Reinforcement learning or scheduling algorithms to optimize task order.
* Optional: neural networks to learn user behavior and adapt scheduling suggestions over time.
## Challenges

While the AI assistant can help optimize daily schedules, it does not solve all time management problems. Limitations include:
* The system depends on accurate user input; incorrect task durations or priorities may reduce effectiveness.
* It cannot account for unexpected events or emergencies.
* Ethical considerations include data privacy and security, as users' schedules and personal information are sensitive.
* Over-reliance on AI recommendations may reduce personal decision-making skills.
## What next?

Future improvements for the AI assistant could include:
* Integration with smart home devices and wearable technology for more context-aware scheduling.
* Advanced natural language processing to allow users to input tasks in plain language.
* Collaborative scheduling for teams or families, considering multiple users' tasks and priorities.
* Gamification and motivation techniques to encourage task completion.
* Continuous learning to better adapt to user habits and preferences over time.
